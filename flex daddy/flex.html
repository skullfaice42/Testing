                Yor Forger, also known as Yor Briar, is one of the main characters in Spy x Family. She leads a double life, working as a mild-mannered clerk at City Hall while secretly being an elite assassin known as "Thorn Princess." Despite her lethal skills and cool demeanor in her professional life, Yor is socially awkward, especially when it comes to relationships. She enters a fake marriage with Loid Forger, a spy, to maintain her cover, though she becomes a devoted and caring wife and stepmother to Anya. Yor is strong, quick, and efficient in combat, yet her kindness and desire to protect her loved ones shine through.
