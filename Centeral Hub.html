    <h1>Heading 1</h1>


    <p>paragraphs go here (used with P)</p>
    


    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>unordered list
            <li>and here
            <li>created with... <br>ul <br>-----li <br>-----li <br>-----li <br>ul
        </ul>
            <p> keep in mind that li is <strong> ALWAYS </strong> needed when creating a list (you can decide if its ol (ordered list, or (ul) unordeded list))   </p>

    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>this is an ordered</li>
            <li>hehe(ol does not use bullets)</li>    
    
        </ol>

    <h4><em>Heading 4</em></h4>
        <p>
            <em>
                The em turns your words into italics, It stands for “emphasis”
            </em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                <em>
                    We could also do something like this, though its a bit much
                </em>
            </strong>
        </p>
    <hr>
        <p>
            Think of the line break as “horizontal rule”... in other words, straight... 
            which is what this is... (hr)<br> Fun fact... when you do break (br) and
            horizontal rule (hr), you dont need to finish them off (unless you want
            to be wierd)... but thats on you
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            this is how you use the <a href="favorite images.html"> link </a>
                <br>
            Page 2<a href="page 2.html"> here</a> (href stands for hyperlink)

        <br>
        <p>Link to <a href='Images/bunny girl senpai.jpe'>Bunny girl Senpai</a>.</p>
        <p>you use the a href= for calling an image when you click the hyperlink</p>
                    

    <h2>This is how to use an image</h2>
        <p> it looks like when you add an image then link to 
            somewhere, the images no longer go side by side </p>
    <br>
        <p>you can also use the 'width' and 'height' to change them 
        <br>
        (DONT add a unit of mesurement)</p>
        <img src="Images/bunny girl senpai.jpe" width="300" height=""/>

    <h2>wanna know how to use a gif </h2>
        <img src='gif/ralph yay.gif'width="300"/>

    <h2> im just doing this for fun at this point</h2>
        <img src="Images/your lie in april.webp" width="300" alt="your lie in april"/>
        <br>
        adding 'alt' makes it so, people that are blind, HEAR it instead of seeing it
        </p>

    <h2>
        Character List
    </h2>
        <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>bir</li>
            <li>iki</li>
            <li>üç</li>
            <li>dört</li>
            <li>beş</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
            should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
