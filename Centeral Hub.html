    <h2>Heading 2</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>ordered list
            <li>and here
            <li>created with... <br>ul <br>-----li <br>-----li <br>-----li <br>ul
        </ul>
            <p> keep in mind that li is <strong> ALWAYS </strong> needed when creating a list (you can decide if its ol (ordered list, or (ul) unordeded list))   </p>

    <h4><em>Heading 4</em></h4>
        <p>
            <em>
                The em turns your words into italics, It stands for “emphasis”
            </em>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                <em>
                    We could also do something like this, though its a bit much
                </em>
            </strong>
        </p>
    <hr>
        <p>
            Think of the line break as “horizontal rule”... in other words, straight... 
            which is what this is... (hr)<br> Fun fact... when you do break (br) and
            horizontal rule (hr), you dont need to finish them off (unless you want
            to be wierd)... but thats on you
