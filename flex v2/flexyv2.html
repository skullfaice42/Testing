            <h2>Ayla card</h2>
            <p>In Ayla we trust <br> Ayla is the main character from "Ayla Sometimes Hides Her Feelings." She is a shy and emotional girl who tries not to show her true feelings to those around her. Ayla has a gentle and kind personality, but due to her lack of confidence, she often keeps to herself and avoids drawing attention. She fears being misunderstood or rejected, which leads her to hide her real emotions. Despite this, Ayla is deeply loyal to her friends and is willing to help them in difficult times, even if it means stepping out of her comfort zone. Her appearance reflects her soft nature: light-colored hair and large eyes that reveal her inner vulnerability</p>
